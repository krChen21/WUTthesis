   title = {Advances in intelligent and autonomous navigation systems for small UAS},
   journal = {Progress in Aerospace Sciences},
   volume = {115},
   pages = {100617},
   abstract = {A significant growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations has been observed over the past decade, largely driven by the emergence of new commercial opportunities and use-cases. This has posed new technological and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex safety, efficiency and sustainability requirements associated with UAS operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance requirements on Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS), both in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS implementations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.},

   abstract = {Robots such as drones, ground rovers, underwater vehicles and industrial robots have increased in popularity in recent years. Many sectors have benefited from this by increasing productivity while also decreasing costs and certain risks to humans. These robots can be controlled individually but are more efficient in a large group, also known as a swarm. However, an increase in the quantity and complexity of robots creates the need for an adequate control system. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence paradigm, is an increasingly popular approach to control a swarm of unmanned vehicles. The quantity of reviews in the field of reinforcement learning-based swarm robotics is limited. We propose reviewing the various applications, algorithms and simulators on the subject to fill this gap. First, we present the current applications on swarm robotics with a focus on reinforcement learning control systems. Subsequently, we define important reinforcement learning terminologies, followed by a review of the current state-of-the-art in the field of swarm robotics utilizing reinforcement learning. Additionally, we review the various simulators used to train, validate and simulate swarms of unmanned vehicles. We finalize our review by discussing our findings and the possible directions for future research. Overall, our review demonstrates the potential and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based control systems for swarm robotics.},

   abstract = {Wildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses. These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs — topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.},

   abstract = {Decision analysis and risk analysis have grown up around a set of organizing questions: what might go wrong, how likely is it to do so, how bad might the consequences be, what should be done to maximize expected utility and minimize expected loss or regret, and how large are the remaining risks? In probabilistic causal models capable of representing unpredictable and novel events, probabilities for what will happen, and even what is possible, cannot necessarily be determined in advance. Standard decision and risk analysis questions become inherently unanswerable (“undecidable”) for realistically complex causal systems with “open-world” uncertainties about what exists, what can happen, what other agents know, and how they will act. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques enable agents (e.g., robots, drone swarms, and automatic controllers) to learn, plan, and act effectively despite open-world uncertainties in a host of practical applications, from robotics and autonomous vehicles to industrial engineering, transportation and logistics automation, and industrial process control. This chapter offers an AI/machine learning perspective on recent ideas for making decision and risk analysis (even) more useful. It reviews undecidability results and recent principles and methods for enabling intelligent agents to learn what works and how to complete useful tasks, adjust plans as needed, and achieve multiple goals safely and reasonably efficiently when possible, despite open-world uncertainties and unpredictable events. In the near future, these principles could contribute to the formulation and effective implementation of more effective plans and policies in business, regulation, and public policy, as well as in engineering, disaster management, and military and civil defense operations. They can extend traditional decision and risk analysis to deal more successfully with open-world novelty and unpredictable events in large-scale real-world planning, policy-making, and risk management. In summary, although it can be proved that key risk analysis questions are unanswerable in many realistically complex and uncertain systems, AI breakthroughs provide constructive ways to decide what to do next if even traditional decision and risk analysis are impossible.},

Vehicular mobility patterns and traffic models are the keys to assisting a wide range of analyses and simulations in these applications. This study surveys the status quo of vehicular mobility models, with a focus on recent advances in the last decade. To provide a comprehensive and systematic review, the study first puts forth a requirement-model-application framework in the IoV or general communication and transportation networks. Existing vehicular mobility models are categorized into vehicular distribution, vehicular traffic, and driving behavior models. Such categorization has a particular emphasis on the random patterns of vehicles in space, traffic flow models aligned to road maps, and individuals’ driving behaviors (e.g., lane-changing and car-following). The different categories of the models are applied to various application scenarios, including underlying network connectivity analysis, off-line network optimization, online network functionality, and real-time autonomous driving. Finally, several important research opportunities arise and deserve continuing research efforts, such as holistic designs of deep learning platforms which take the model parameters of vehicular mobility as input features, qualification of vehicular mobility models in terms of representativeness and completeness, and new hybrid models incorporating different categories of vehicular mobility models to improve the representativeness and completeness.},

Since its origin, the number of infected and deceased cases has been growing exponentially in almost all the affected countries of the world. The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world results in the scarcity of medical resources and overburdened hospitals. As a result, the researchers and technocrats are continuously working across the world for the inculcation of efficient strategies which may assist the government and healthcare system in controlling and managing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study provides an extensive review of the ongoing strategies such as diagnosis, prediction, drug and vaccine development and preventive measures used in combating the COVID-19 along with technologies used and limitations. Moreover, this review also provides a comparative analysis of the distinct type of data, emerging technologies, approaches used in diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19, statistics of contact tracing apps, vaccine production platforms used in the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the study highlights some challenges and pitfalls observed in the systematic review which may assist the researchers to develop more efficient strategies used in controlling and managing the spread of COVID-19.},

   note = {(Michael)},
   abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have made remarkable developments and are anticipated to replace human drivers. In transitioning from human-driven vehicles to fully AVs, one crucial task is to predict the trajectories of the subject vehicle and its surrounding vehicles in real time. Most existing methods of vehicle trajectory prediction on highways are based on physical models or purely data-driven models. However, they either yield unsatisfactory prediction performance or lack model interpretability and physical implications. This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Deep Learning framework that fully leverages the advantages of data-driven and physics-based models to go beyond the existing models. We use the Transformer neural network architecture with self-attention as Physics-Uninformed Neural Network (PUNN) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as physical model to construct of Physics-Informed Transformer-Intelligent Driver Model (PIT-IDM). Extensive experiments have been conducted on two datasets with different traffic environments, i.e., Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) data in the US and the Ubiquitous Traffic Eyes (UTE) data in China, to verify model accuracy and efficiency. Compared with the three kinds of baselines by relative and absolute measures of effectiveness, the best performing PIT-IDM reduces longitudinal trajectory prediction errors for long horizons by 5%-50%, some even reduced up to 70%. Extensive empirical analyses have been carried out to verify its excellent spatio-temporal transferability and explore the physics-informed mechanism underlying this deep learning method. The training and inference time analysis indicates that although it takes longer to train PIT-IDM, it requires fewer calls and accumulates fewer errors with less computation time in real-world applications. The overall results further validate the efficacy of this Physics-Informed Deep Learning framework in enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and transferability.},

   abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) refer to a range of transportation applications based on communication and information technology. These systems by the aid of modern ideas, provide comfortable, efficient and safe services for transportation users. They are located in the linkage of information technology, computer science, electrical engineering, system analysis, civil engineering, and optimization. They form a main branch of the smart cities and are fundamental for the development of countries. ITS applications, usually, use the capabilities of sensor networks, electrical devices, and computer processing units to deliver a service, however, they are not limited to the hardware devices. Instead, the modeling of transportation problems and solving them efficiently are more challenging problems. Especially, when they support good ideas for controlling the transportation systems or guiding some users. In this chapter, the application of optimization models for the transportation context are discussed. To this end, the models for data collection by a sensor network are needed. Then, for mining these data and extracting the necessary knowledge for transportation context awareness, some fundamental models such as regression analysis, frequent pattern mining, clustering or classification can be applied. These backgrounds are used to extend the appropriate models of ITS in an integrated architecture. To solve these models, the classical network and combinatorial optimization methods, simulation-optimization techniques, and metaheuristic algorithms will be explained. Then, we categorize the applications of these optimization models in the different subsystems of ITS architecture. The output of this investigation can be used to develop different ITS services for the urban and inter-cities networks.},

Game theory, a mathematical tool helps in solving various problems of wireless communication related to security, resource allocation, power management, energy harvesting, spectrum usage, coverage, connectivity, capacity, reliability, efficiency, optimum bandwidth, rewards and punishments of wireless nodes, and balancing of various trade-offs. This paper presents a comprehensive review, potential benefits of applying game theory (GT) in wireless communication (WC). For this purpose, a detailed overview of GT including cooperative and non-cooperative games, Q-learning, and reinforcement learning for different applications like cellular communication, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, cognitive radio (CR), device-to-device (D2D), wireless sensor networks (WSN) and many other applications that are pertinent to wireless networks is presented. In addition, various important design and optimization challenges are addressed. Two GT-based case studies related to physical layer security and resource allocation are also presented. In a nutshell, GT models enhanced by various learning algorithms has the potential to optimize the configuration parameters of any wireless network. Finally, we reflect the future directions and the challenges based on GT to improvise the performance of the wireless systems in the 5G technology and beyond.},

The dynamic model of the quadrotor is first obtained using Newton-Euler equations. Then, considering the underactuated and the strongly coupled characteristics of the quadrotor system, a nonlinear adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) scheme is proposed. Meanwhile, additional adaptive laws are designed to estimate all the parameters of the quadrotor system, which in principle are difficult to be measured directly and accurately. Furthermore, to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, the upper bound of the fully unknown external disturbance is estimated and adopted as the switching gain of the ASMC. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme, where the superiority to linear quadratic control (LQR) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) has been demonstrated clearly.},

   abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) are being increasingly deployed for commercial, civilian, and military applications. The current UAS state-of-the-art still depends on a remote human controller with robust wireless links to perform several of these applications. The lack of autonomy restricts the domains of application and tasks for which a UAS can be deployed. This is even more relevant in tactical and rescue scenarios where the UAS needs to operate in a harsh operating environment with unreliable wireless links. Enabling autonomy and intelligence to the UAS will help overcome this hurdle and expand its use improving safety and efficiency. The exponential increase in computing resources and the availability of large amount of data in this digital era has led to the resurgence of machine learning from its last winter. Therefore, in this chapter, we discuss how some of the advances in machine learning, specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning can be leveraged to develop next-generation autonomous UAS. We first begin motivating this chapter by discussing the application, challenges, and opportunities of the current UAS in the introductory section. We then provide an overview of some of the key deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques discussed throughout this chapter. A key area of focus that will be essential to enable autonomy to UAS is computer vision. Accordingly, we discuss how deep learning approaches have been used to accomplish some of the basic tasks that contribute to providing UAS autonomy. Then we discuss how reinforcement learning is explored for using this information to provide autonomous control and navigation for UAS. Next, we provide the reader with directions to choose appropriate simulation suites and hardware platforms that will help to rapidly prototype novel machine learning based solutions for UAS. We additionally discuss the open problems and challenges pertaining to each aspect of developing autonomous UAS solutions to shine light on potential research areas. Finally, we provide a brief account of the UAS safety and regulations prior to concluding the chapter.},

   volume = {94},
   pages = {126-151},
   abstract = {Seamless positioning and navigation requires an integration of outdoor and indoor positioning systems. Until recently, these systems mostly function in-silos. Though GNSS has become a standalone system for outdoors, no unified positioning modality could be found for indoor environments. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals are popular choices though. Increased adoption of different machine learning techniques for indoor–outdoor context detection and localization could be witnessed in the recent literature. The difficulty in precise data annotation, need for sensor fusion, the effect of different hardware configurations pose critical challenges that affect the success of indoor–outdoor (IO) positioning systems. Wireless sensor-based techniques are explicitly programmed, hence estimating locations dynamically becomes challenging. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to overcome such situations and react appropriately by self-learning through experiences and actions without human intervention or reprogramming. Hence, the focus of the work is to present the readers a comprehensive survey of the applicability of machine learning and deep learning to achieve seamless navigation. The paper systematically discusses the application perspectives, research challenges, and the framework of ML (mostly) and DL (a few) based positioning approaches. The comparisons against various parameters like the technology used, the procedure applied, output metric and challenges are presented along with experimental results on benchmark datasets. The paper contributes to bridging the IO localization approaches with IO detection techniques so as to pave the way into the research domain for seamless positioning. Recent advances and hence, possible future research directions in the context of IO localization have also been articulated.},

We use sparse experimental data to estimate the interference area between palm sized quadcopters and to derive physics-infused models that describe how the air-draft generated by two quadcopters (flying one above the other) affect each other. The observed significant altitude deviations due to airdraft interactions, mainly in the lower quadcopter, is adequately captured by our physics infused machine learning model. We use two strategies to mitigate these effects. First, we propose non-invasive, online and offline trajectory re-planning strategies that allow avoiding the interference zone while reducing the deviations from desired minimum snap trajectories. Second, we propose invasive strategies that re-design control algorithms by incorporating the interference model. We demonstrate how to modify the standard quadcopter PID controller, and how to formulate a model predictive control approach when considering the interference model. Both invasive and non-invasive strategies show significant reduction in tracking error and control signal energy as compared to the case where the interference area is ignored.},

   abstract = {This study reviews the advancement of apple-related technology in six distinct domains: pruning, pollinating, thinning, bagging, harvesting, and sorting. Firstly, the pruning section discusses machine vision systems and moves on to mechanical branch-cutting methods, followed by automated apple pruning. Secondly, concerning pollination, we primarily focus on the growth of apple fruits, beginning with identifying blossoms, using artificial pollen, and mechanized pollination. Thirdly, in the thinning section, a review of achievements of the vision systems and mechanical and robotic thinning technologies. Fourthly, in apple bagging, we address the effects of apple bagging strategies, including the primary procedures, varieties of bags, and influencing aspects. Next, in the harvesting part, the view focuses on the vision strategies and recognition systems that include visible light, spectral, and thermal imaging by means of thorough analysis that considers the time, observations, techniques, and findings. After that, the localization of the apple assists in separating apples such as leaves, branches, and other overlapping apples, in addition to instructing end-effectors on how to grasp and extract apples. Furthermore, harvester robots’ progress includes developments in machinery, grippers, arms, and manipulators, besides the assistance platforms for harvesting. Developing the machinery for sorting apples is the final area of focus. The machinery includes conveyors, sorting executors, and bin fillers. Vision systems imaging types and methods are followed by illumination systems, and identification strategies such as machine and deep learning algorithms are considered. In limitations and future views, we summarize the challenges of the six distinct domains and provide opportunities and future perspectives. By confirming the economic advantages and sustaining the expansion of academic organizations for technology development and industry, the study assists in boosting apple fruit quality and production.},

   abstract = {Unmanned or Autonomous Systems act in an uncertain world. In order to plan and make decisions, autonomous systems can only rely on noisy perceptions and approximated models. The data collected from sensors is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. Due to the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. Under these conditions, deep learning algorithms can be fully integrated into robotic systems only if a measure of prediction uncertainty is available. Prediction uncertainty in deep neural networks generally derives from two sources: data uncertainty and model uncertainty. The former arises because of noise in the data, usually caused by the sensors’ imperfections. The latter instead is generated from unbalances in the training data distribution. The article describes the developing fully autonomous vehicles at three levels, namely, perception, planning and control. Ideas from artificial intelligence have also been used to solve planning problems for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have to deal with dynamic, non-stationary- and highly unpredictable operational environments. For the right understanding of this process, is described the best-known control strategies, map representation techniques, interaction with external systems, including pedestrian interactions under an informational conception of Internet of Things and Big Data Uncertainty and Uncertainty in Machine Learning, The article shows an analysis of the most promissory methods for treating the deep leaning uncertainty: Bayesian Deep Learning, which is an intersection between deep learning and Bayesian probability approaches and the Fuzzy logic machine learning, in an Internet of Things framework. For the validation of theoretical explanations, it was proposed some simulations tools for visualizing and interpreting the uncertainty in the previously mentioned models and in the internet of things framework in different environments, useful for teaching and research.},

Firstly, the multi-obstacle environment is set up, and the gaming situation can be judged by the perception between pursuit-evasion USVs. For the pursuers, the model training is performed based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, so that they can quickly plan a reasonable obstacle avoidance and pursuit route, and form an effective encirclement posture before the evader approaches the target point. Meanwhile, the credit assignment problem among the members of the pursuing group is considered. For the evader, deep reinforcement learning is combined with imitation learning to train the escape model, so that it can reach the preset point in as short a time as possible and avoid the obstacles on the way. Finally, an adversarial-evolutionary game training method under multiple random scenarios is designed and combined with curriculum learning to iteratively update the pursuit and escape models. Through the detailed comparative analysis of the model training process and simulation experiments, it is proved that the proposed two types of models have higher convergence efficiency and stability, and they can have higher intelligence to pursue, escape and avoid obstacles respectively.},

   abstract = {Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) is a promising technology that fuses sensor data and historical state-of-health information of components and subsystems to provide actionable information and enable intelligent decision-making regarding the operation and maintenance of aerospace systems. ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS).},

   abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are frequently utilized for transferring and delivering. Dual- or multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation schemes are required for heavy loads. In this work, focusing on the path planning for a dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, a unique artificial potential field-A*(APF-A*) algorithm is studied to fulfill the safe and effective cooperative suspension transport. APF-A* algorithm proposed the strategy of host-wingman cooperative transportation based on the APF theory, and optimizes the heuristic function by introducing the concept of repulsive force to maintain the quadrotor flying at a safe distance from the obstacle. In addition, APF-A* algorithm promises to increase search efficiency while identifying the optimal path, and it can reduce the swing angle motion of loads to enhance the security of transportation. The coordinated flight control and path planning of quadrotor UAVs are simulated in AirSim environment and tested in flight experiments. The results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable to plan safe and reliable paths, meanwhile changing formation and avoid collision when the wingman is close to obstacles. In comparison to the regular A* algorithm, the APF-A* algorithm proposed in the paper performs better in path planning for dual-quadrotor cooperative transport system, reducing the search time and the number of search grids by nearly 60% and 53.75%, respectively.},

   abstract = {Autonomy and autonomous systems are occupying central stage in the research community, as autonomous vehicles are proliferating and their utility in all aspects of the military and civilian domains are increasing exponentially from one year to the next. The development and application of resiliency and safety technologies to autonomous systems is, unfortunately, not keeping pace with their growth rate. Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. Among them is the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, significant challenges in the area of human-machine interface requiring significant human intervention to operate and interpret sensor data, the need for emerging machine learning technologies and, most importantly, the resilient design and operation of complex systems to assure their safety, reliability and availability when executing missions in unstructured and cluttered environments. Recent advances in resiliency and safety of complex engineered systems have focused on methods/tools to tradeoff system performance for increased time to failure aiming at mission completion or trial and error methods to arrive at a suboptimal policy for system self-organization in the presence of a failure mode. This paper introduces a novel framework for the resilient design and operation of such complex systems via self-organization and control reconfiguration strategies that avoid empirical trial and error techniques and may be implemented and perform in real time on-platform. The main theme is summarized as: “a healthy and resilient system is a safe system”. To accomplish this objective, we introduce an integrated and rigorous approach to resilient design while safety considerations ascertain that the targeted system is contained within a safe envelope. A resilient system is robustly and flexibly monitoring its internal and external environment, it can detect and anticipate disturbances that may affect its operational integrity and take appropriate action to compensate for the disturbance. Resilience enhances safety while improving risk factors and assures that vehicles subjected to extreme disturbances remain within their safe envelope. The enabling technologies begin with graph spectral and epidemic spreading modeling tools to represent the system behaviors under normal and faulty conditions; a Markov Decision Process is the basic self-organization module. We are introducing a novel approach to fault-tolerance by considering the impacts of severe fault modes on system performance as inputs to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that trades off system performance with control activity in order to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unmanned system. Performance metrics are defined and assist in the algorithmic developments and their validation. We pursue an integrated and verifiable methodology to safety assurance that enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Several unmanned autonomous systems are used for demonstration purposes.},

   journal = {Information Fusion},

   abstract = {With its unique advantages of high flexibility and high efficiency, UAV has become a reasonable substitute for conventional aerial measurement technology. Especially in the low altitude remote sensing image processing, the ortho-rectification and mosaic of aerial images are the key to vision-based UAV orthoimage generation. Therefore, how to select the appropriate methods to rectify and mosaic the aerial images of UAV is significance to research the automatic generation of digital orthoimages. Unfortunately, most of the existing reviews only focus on the general image mosaic techniques, and there are few special reports on the application of UAV orthoimage generation for reference. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on UAV orthoimage generation technologies. We conclude three mainstream frameworks of visual orthoimage generation, which are 2D mosaic framework based, SfM framework based and SLAM framework based methods. According to the above three specific frameworks, we first carried out a detailed description and comparative analysis of related important algorithms, and sorted out the differences, common points and inherent relationships. Considering the wide application of deep learning in UAV remote sensing, we propose some hypotheses on how to introduce deep learning technology into above three orthoimage generation frameworks. After analysis, we provide a more detailed performance quantification comparison of the two most recent potential frameworks (State-of-the-art methods based on SfM and SLAM). It is worth noting that we integrated different test data sources of UVA aerial video sequence with a general SLAM testing platform, and solve the issue that SLAM-based orthoimage generation methods are difficult to evaluate cross-platform. Finally, challenges about visual UAV orthoimage generation and future directions in addressing these challenges are also pointed out.},

   title = {A service function chain mapping scheme based on functional aggregation in space-air-ground integrated networks},
   journal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},
   volume = {224},
   pages = {103829},
   abstract = {Being a novel network architecture, the Space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) offers advantages such as extensive network coverage and seamless ubiquitous access. However, it also encounters the challenge of balancing a growing user demand with limited network service resources. In order to further improve the utilization rate of network resources, a group of virtual network functions can be connected according to certain business logic to form a dynamic reconfigurable service function chain. This can provide diversified and high-quality network services for users. So by aggregating the same type of network function, we can reduce the cost of service chain mapping. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes an Aggregation of Service Function Chain mapping algorithm (A-SFC). The aggregated service function chain topology is mapped according to an improved isomorphic graph search mapping algorithm, resulting in a deployment solution that minimizes the mapping cost by aggregating static SFC requests by end-system division. Experimental results show that the algorithm is able to find an effective mapping scheme under resource constraints. In addition to reducing computation, the algorithm effectively minimizes the consumption of computational resources while delivering excellent performance in terms of service delay and mapping cost.},
